# Analog Clock

This project is adapted from [the clock in the list of Svelte examples](https://svelte.dev/examples/clock). All I did was rewrite it in standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also used [a visually hidden element](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/) to make the time accessible to screen readers. I have tested this using VoiceOver in Safari 16.1 on macOS Monterey 12.6.1. For example, it reads as "6 hours, 42 minutes, and 14 seconds".
